# Data Structures

I see a computer as a bunch of memory blocks(Memory module) and a super fast compute machine(Processing module) that can do all kind of simple maths and logical operations like addition, multiplications, OR, AND  etc in a super super fast manner.

It is us the humans who programms a computer to utilize the memory blocks to do preety cleaver stuff.

We try to organize and store the data like numbers, characters etc in preety smart ways in those memory blocks, and they are called data structures, these data structures are than used by algorithms to do very smart calculations.

Therefore, I believe that data structures are the foundation of computer science, because they define how data is represented and accessed, which in turn determines how effectively any computation can be carried out.

And every program we use , even the colors you see on the computer screen , the music you hear coming through the speakers , the mouse cursor that moves whe
you move the mouse are all just computations done by the computer.

Everything in a computer is a result of clever data manipulation and fast computation â€” no magic, just math and logic.
