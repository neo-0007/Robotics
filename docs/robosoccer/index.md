# RoboSoccer Overview

Our first robotics project was our RoboSoccer bot.  
It’s not a human like robot playing soccer with robotic legs — it’s a simple RC-controlled, four-wheeled bot (you can think of it as a small car) that pushes the ball toward the goal. Matches are usually 1v1.

## **The Bot**

Here is our first build. I think it looked pretty good — but unfortunately, it broke during its very first match. :(

</div>

Here is our V2. I don’t have a great photo of it, and it doesn’t look better than V1 — but it managed to score a few goals and lasted until the end. It was a good improvement!

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 12px; justify-content: center;">

</div>

Here are some images of bots from other teams. They are much more advanced and built by teams with way more experience than us.

## **The Arena**

This is what an arena looks like. It’s about 2.5m by 2m in size.

## **The Game**

The objective of the game is the same as in regular football: score goals. The team that scores the most goals wins the match.

Here is a clip from one of our games. As you can see, it’s more like sumo wrestling than football!
