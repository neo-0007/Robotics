# Robosoccer Overview

Our first robotics project was our robosoccer bot
It's not a human like robot playing soccer with its robotic legs , its a simple RC controlled four wheeled bot (you can say its a car) that pushes the ball to the goal, and it's mostly a 1v1 match.

## **The Bot**
Here is our first build , it looks good according to me , but it broke during its first fight :(

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 12px; justify-content: center;">

  <img src="../assets/images/robosoccer-bot-v1-side.jpg" alt="Bot V1 Side" style="width: 30%; border-radius: 8px;">
  <img src="../assets/images/robosoccer-bot-v1-top.jpg" alt="Bot V1 Top" style="width: 30%; border-radius: 8px;">
  
</div>


Here is our v2 , I do not have a good click of it , it does not looks better than v1, but it was able to score some goals and lasted till the end , it was a good improvement !

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 12px; justify-content: center;">

  <img src="../assets/images/robosoccer-bot-v2-top.jpg" alt="Bot V2 Top" style="width: 30%; border-radius: 8px;">

</div>

Here are some images of bots of other teams , which are way better than us and has way more expeience than us

## **The Game**

The objective of the game is same as normal football , to score goals , the team that scores the most goals wins the match 

Here is a clip from one of our game , as you can see its more like sumo than football
